I didn't play space invader, so this is one of the game I have no idea what to improve initially.
After the tutorial finished, my idea is to make it play continuously.
My idea is to make the game more difficult over time by increasing the time between player's laser shots, but worth it because of exponentially increasing score.
I didn't know what the behaviour of the original Space Invader was until I coded my modifications.
Turns out in the original, the enemy moves faster over time.
